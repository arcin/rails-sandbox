# step_1_file_structure

The purpose of this step is to familiarize you with Rails file structure. This will happen through a series of Readmes. Each folder has a Readme file that explains it's purpose and contents.


## What's in this folder:
  - app: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - config: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - db: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - doc: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - lib: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - log: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - public: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - script: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - test: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - vendor: see folder-specific Readme for details.
  - config.ru: This file is used by Rack-based servers to start the application. Don't mess with it.
  - Gemfile: All your gem dependencies.
  - Rakefile: Loads all of your rake tasks
