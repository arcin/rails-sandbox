# Vendor Folder
[3rd party code, code that's not yours, goes here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.13/asset_pipeline.html)
## What's in this folder:
- assets folder:
  - javascripts folder: javascript code that you didn't write. e.g. jquery plugins, bootstrap javascript, etc.
  - stylesheets folder: stylesheets code that you didn't write. e.g. jquery ui, bootstrap stylesheets, normalize.css, etc.
- plugins: Not sure why Rails still includes this, but you won't need to use this file. In older versions of rails, there used to be the idea of plugins vs gems. Plugins are not used as much anymore (almost at all). You can safely ignore the plugins folder.
