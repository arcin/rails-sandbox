# Log Folder
This folder will include server log files that corresponds to each environment (development.log, test.log, etc.). You will not explicitly add any files to this folder, Rails does it for you when you run different servers. Please note that you should never ever ever commit these files. They should be added to a .gitignore file.

## What's in this folder:
- development.log
- test.log
